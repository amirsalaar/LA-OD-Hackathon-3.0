A first look at our data.

```{r}
df
```

Let's answer a question!

Is a registrant's likelihood of completing a course related to the socioeconomic status of the place where they live?

There are two columns in our dataset that can help us answer this question:

* `imd_band`: the Index of Multiple Depravation band of the place where the student lived during the module-presentation.
* `final_result`: studentâ€™s final result in the module-presentation.

## Creating new columns with `mutate()`

![mutate](img/mutate.png)

Our first task is to create a column that tells us whether a registrant completed a course.

Unfortunately, we don't have a column that tells us this information directly. Instead, we have the `final_result` column, which has four values:

* `"Distinction"`
* `"Pass"`
* `"Withdrawn"`
* `"Fail"`

If we want to get just whether they completed the course, we'll need to aggregate `"Distinction"` and `"Pass"` into a single value, and `"Withdrawn"` and `"Fail"` into another.

To do this, we need to write code that does two things:

1. Creates a new column.
2. Fills that column with values we care about.

This is the jumpshot of data wrangling. In R, the easiest way to do it is to use the `mutate()` function, from the `dplyr` package (one of the packages you loaded as part of the `tidyverse`).

```{r}
# We can fill our new column with whatever we like!
df %>% 
  mutate(
    new_column = "hello!"
  )

df %>% 
  mutate(
    new_column = 1
  )

# We can even use the other columns to determine the contents of the new one.
# (This is where the magic happens!)
df %>% 
  mutate(
    activity_per_active_day = total_activity / days_active
  )
```

### Practice time with `mutate()`!

Challenge: using `mutate()` and the `date_registration` and `date_unregistration` columns, create a new column called `length_of_registration_period`.

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(
    #YOUR_ANSWER_HERE!
  )
```

Now. What we actually need to do to answer our question is create a column that tells us whether the student passed their course. A good way to handle this is to use the `case_when()` function.

`case_when()` takes a series of two-side formulas. The left-hand side of each formula is a condition, and the right-hand side is the desired output. For example:

```{r}
cool_values <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

case_when(
  cool_values == TRUE ~ "hey there!",
  cool_values == FALSE ~ "what's up?"
)

cool_numbers <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

case_when(
  cool_numbers <= 5 ~ "small",
  cool_numbers > 5 ~ "BIG!!!!"
)
```

All we need to do now is use `case_when()` within `mutate()` to create a new column that tells us whether the student in each row completed their course:

```{r}
df_mutated <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    completed_course = case_when(
      final_result == "Pass" ~ TRUE,
      final_result == "Distinction" ~ TRUE,
      final_result == "Fail" ~ FALSE,
      final_result == "Withdrawn" ~ FALSE
    )
  )

df_mutated
```

## Computing summaries of subgroups with `group_by()` & `summarise()`

![group_by & summarise](img/group_by_summarise.png)

Now we need to count how many people completed their courses across different values of `imd_band`.

To do this, we can use two functions: `group_by()` and `summarise()`.

`group_by()` specifies which variable(s) you want to use to compute summaries within, and `summarise()` squishes the dataframe down to just one row per group. Here's an example:

```{r}
example_dataframe <- data.frame(
  course  = c("Physics", "Physics", "English", "English", "Geography", "Geography"),
  student = c("Alice",   "Bob",     "Alice",   "Bob",     "Alice",     "Bob"),
  grade   = c(85,        74,        81,        89,        93,          87)
)

# We can group by course and compute the mean grade.
example_dataframe %>% 
  group_by(course) %>% 
  summarise(mean_grade = mean(grade))

# Or we can group by students and compute the mean grade.
example_dataframe %>% 
  group_by(student) %>% 
  summarise(mean_grade = mean(grade))

# Of course, we're not limited to means. We can create other summary values too.
example_dataframe %>% 
  group_by(student) %>% 
  summarise(mean_grade = mean(grade),
            min_grade = min(grade),
            max_grade = max(grade))
```

### Practice time with `group_by()` + `summarise()`!

Using our full open dataset, compute the mean number of days (`days_active`) students were active in each course (`code_module`).

> Hint: there are missing values in `days_active`. To ignore them when using `mean()`, include the argument `na.rm = TRUE`. `na.rm` means "`NA`-remove". (`NA` means "not available" or "not applicable")

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(
    #YOUR_ANSWER_HERE!
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    #YOUR_ANSWER_HERE!
  )
```

To compute the proportion of students in each `imd_band` who completed their courses, we can use a neat trick. Remember: we created a column in which rows were labelled `TRUE` if the student completed the course, and `FALSE` if they didn't. In R, just like in most programming languages, `TRUE` is equivalent to `1`, and `FALSE` is equivalent to `0`. So we can group by `imd_band`, and summarise the mean of our column, `completed_course`. If a particular `imd_band` group has ten students, and four of them have a value of `TRUE` for `completed_course`, the mean will be `0.4`.

```{r}
df_grouped <- df_mutated %>% 
  group_by(imd_band) %>%
  summarise(percent_completed = mean(completed_course))

df_grouped
```

## Subsetting rows with `filter()`

![filter](img/filter.png)

```{r}
df_filtered <- df_grouped %>% 
  filter(!is.na(imd_band))

df_filtered
```

## Plotting with `ggplot()`

```{r}
df_filtered %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(
    aes(
      x = imd_band,
      y = percent_completed
    ),
    alpha = 0.8,
    stat = "identity"
  )
```

## Putting it all together

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(completed_course = case_when(
           final_result == "Pass" ~ TRUE,
           final_result == "Distinction" ~ TRUE,
           final_result == "Fail" ~ FALSE,
           final_result == "Withdrawn" ~ FALSE
         )) %>% 
  group_by(imd_band) %>%
  summarise(percent_completed = mean(completed_course)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(imd_band)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = imd_band, y = percent_completed)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8, stat = "identity")
```
